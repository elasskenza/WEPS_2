> Women in Economics Paris and Saclay (WEPS) is an initiative dedicated to evaluate, reflect on and improve the place of women and gender minorities in Economics.
 We do so by diffusing academic knowledge on gender imbalances, creating spaces to share experiences, and strengthening connections between women economists and economists from gender minorities.


**Next event:** blablabla.
